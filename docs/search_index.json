Let's take a carbon monooxide (CO) molecule as an example.\nThe energy here means the total energy, which is the sum of the electronic energy and the nuclear repulsion energy. The total energy is the energy expectation value of Schroedinger equation (under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation).\nIn VASP, you always need INCAR, POSCAR, KPOINTS, and POTCAR files.\nThese files should be stored in the same directory, and one directry corresponds to one VASP calculation. The VASP command should be executed in that directory.\nThe example here is taken from the VaspWiki: https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/CO\n\nINCAR\n\nThis file specifies the computational condition in VASP. In this file, you need to specify tag-variable pairs.\nVariable might be integer, float, logical (.TRUE. or .FALSE.), and string.\nThe minimal INCAR file is something like below. The details will be explained later or see VaspWiki website.\n\nSYSTEM = CO molecule in a box\nISMEAR =  0\nNSW    =  0\nIBRION = -1\n\nThe keywords above is just simple examples of the INCAR tags. These mean\nSYSTEM: A free keyword to identify the calculation.\nISMEAR: This tag sets a smearing method for the electron occupation near the Fermi level.\nNSW: This tag controls the number of ionic steps i.e. geometry optimization steps.\nIBRION: Controls the motion of ions. IBRION = -1 means energy calculation at given geometry.\n\n\nDetails of other INCAR tags are explained in incar.md.\n\nPOSCAR\n\nThis file gives the element species and positions of atoms.\nPOSCAR consists of three parts:\nThe top part gives the size of the unit cell.\nThe middle part gives the number of each elements.\nThe last part gives x-, y-, and z-coordinates of atoms.\n\n\n\nCO molecule in a box\n1.0\n8.0 0.0 0.0\n0.0 8.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 8.0\nC O\n1 1\nCartesian\n0.0 0.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 1.1\n\nEach lines have following meanings:\nCO molecule in a box: Title\n1.0          : universal scaling parameters\n8.0 0.0 0.0  : lattice vector  a(1)\n0.0 8.0 0.0  : lattice vector  a(2)\n0.0 0.0 8.0  : lattice vector  a(3)\nC O          : elements (this line can be omitted)\n1 1          : number of atoms for each species\nCartesian    : positions in cartesian coordinates\n0.0 0.0 0.0  : first atom x, y, z (in Angstrom)\n0.0 0.0 1.1  : second atom x, y, z (in Angstrom)\n\n\nNote that the first line of xyz-coordinate part has two lines. The first line corresponds to the carbon atom, and the second does the oxygen atom. So the xyz-coordinate part uses the information of the middle part (element number specification).\nFor example, to calculate CO2 molecule\n\n...\nC O\n1 2\ncart\n0.0 0.0 1.1   ! carbon\n0.0 0.0 0.0   ! oxygen\n0.0 0.0 2.2   ! oxygen\nKPOINTS\n\nThis file specifies the number of k-points, used for the reciprocal lattice integration.\nThe details of the k-points will be given elsewhere.\nFor the isolated atom/molecule calculation, you should use the following KPOINTS file corresponding to the Gamma-point calculation.\n\nGamma-point only\n0\nMonkhorst Pack\n1 1 1\n0 0 0\nPOTCAR\n\nThis file has the information of pseudo-potentials of each element.\nPseudo-potential information of all elements in POSCAR should be stored one POTCAR file.\nIn VASP, mehtod called the projector augumented-wave (PAW) is used.\nPOTCAR file can be generated by the Linux command:\ncat {POTCAR_directory}/C/POTCAR > POTCAR\ncat {POTCAR_directory}/O/POTCAR >> POTCAR\n\n\nNote that cat text_file > new_file copies the text file to a new file, and cat text_file >> new_file appends to new_file.\n{POTCAR_directory} depends on the installation setting. If you don't know the directry, ask your superviser.\nUsually, a directory like potpaw... is what you want.\n\nExecuting VASP\n\nWhen all the files i.e. INCAR, POSCAR, KPOINTS, and POTCAR are made, you can execute the vasp in the directory.\nNote: the following command is if you have VASP in your computer. If you are using supercomputers, use different command (see the following section).\nvasp_std >& {output_filename}\n\n\nTo execute above, vasp_std should be included in the directories in your PATH.\n\nHow to execute job in supercomputers\n\nNow we will asssume using TSUBAME.\nThe supercomputer usually uses the job queueing system, to take control of the calculations of many users. The queing system assigns the jobs to vacant nodes (computers).\nYou need to submit the job in a login node, the computer you first login to use the TSUBAME. The computation is done in other nodes, and you do not need to login these computational nodes.\nYou need to write the command in the job script file (with .sh or .csh filetype).

The energy is defined in eV (electron volt) unit.\n\n\n\nVisualization\nVESTA\n\nFor visualization, you can use VESTA for free: https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/jp/\nAfter installing VESTA, you can see the structure of POSCAR by \"Open\" -> \"POSCAR\".\nIt is useful to set alias to ~/.bashrc file (in mac)\nalias vesta=/Applications/VESTA.app/Contents/MacOS/VESTA\n\nthen you can use vesta POSCAR.\n\n\nASE\n\nWhen using ASE, you can see the POSCAR file with: ase gui POSCAR.\n\nOvito\n\nOvito visualization software is sometimes useful because it has many functionalities (that VESTA doen't have): https://www.ovito.org/\n\nExercise\n\nFor CO molecule, change the position of the second atom (O atom, 0.0 0.0 1.1 in the above example) to 0.9, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.3 and see the change in the energy.

Usually this axis is set as z-direction.\nTo cut the periodicity of z-direction, a vacant region called vacuum layer in inserted in the surface calculaiton.\n\nMaking POSCAR\n\nIt is possible to make the surface file with VESTA; see https://qiita.com/h-nabata/items/290a575e07a2e56c7c94\nIt is rather complicated. So we will use Atomic simulation environment (ASE) instead.\n\nASE\n\nASE is useful Python library for theoretical/computational atomic simulations.\nTo setup the Python environment, see; https://github.com/ishikawa-group/python_introduction/blob/main/setup.md.\n\nTo make the POSCAR file for surface (e.g. fcc 111 surface), write and execute the following Python script.\nfrom ase.io import write\nfrom ase.build import fcc111\n\nsurf = fcc111(a=3.92, symbol=\"Pt\", size=[2, 2, 4], vacuum=10.0)\nwrite(\"POSCAR\", surf)\n\n\nYou can check the structure with VESTA, or using ase gui POSCAR if you've installed the ASE.\nThe above script, using the ASE function fcc111, makes the Pt surface with the supercell size of 2x2x4, and introduces the vacuum layer of 10 Angstrom in z-direction. As noted, this vacuum layer is necessary to cut the interaction between upper and lower periodic slabs.\nMore details are given in adsorption.md.\n\nFixing some atoms\n\nIn surface calculations, the lower part of the slab is usually fixed to mimic the bulk structure.\nTo fix some atoms, make the POSCAR as following:Pt\n1.000\n  11.074    0.000    0.000\n   0.000   11.495    0.000\n   0.000    0.000   29.090\nPt\n32\nSelective dynamics\nCartesian\n0.000  2.874  0.100   F F F\n2.768  0.000  0.100   F F F\n0.000  8.621  0.100   T T T\n...\n\nPut Selective dynamics in after the atomic number section.\nPut F F F at the end of atomic species, to freeze x-, y-, and z-coordinate of that atom.\nF means .FALSE. to move that atom, and T means .TRUE. to move. So open some editor, and put F F F at the atoms you want to freeze.\n\nPOTCAR\n\nSame with bulk or molecular calculations.\n\nKPOINTS\n\nFor the surface calculation, just one k-point is OK for the non-periodic direction.

Which is lower (lower is more stable), bulk or surface?\n\n"},"english/optimization.html":{"url":"english/optimization.html","title":"Geometry optimization","keywords":"","body":"Geometry optimization\n\nIn this section, we learn how to do geometry optimization with VASP.\nGeometry optimization is also called ion relaxation, as it is the procedure to move the ion (or nuclei) position to have lower potential energy.\nThus the geometry means the configuration space spanned by many nuclei.\nLower potential energy means molecules, bulk, or surfaces are more stable than the high-potential-energy state. Thus we can consider the stable molecules or bulk (observed experimentally) have the optimized structures.\nThe optimized geometry thus can be compared with exprimental molecular or solid strucutures, which is identified by the X-ray or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods.\n\nOptimization of bulk\nPOSCAR\n\nPOSCAR is the same with the energy calculation.\nLet's take the Pt example (file).Pt \n1.0000000\n   3.9231600    0.0000000    0.0000000\n   0.0000000    3.9231600    0.0000000\n   0.0000000    0.0000000    3.9231600\nPt \n 4\nCartesian\n0.0000000  0.0000000  0.0000000\n1.9615800  1.9615800  0.0000000\n0.0000000  1.9615800  1.9615800\n1.9615800  0.0000000  1.9615800\n\n\nINCAR\n\nThe INCAR file for the geometry optimization is as follows.SYSTEM = Pt bulk\nISMEAR =  1\nNSW    = 10\nIBRION =  2\n\nIBRION = 1 or 2 specifies to do geometry optimization. The difference of 1 and 2 is the optimization algorithm.\nIBRION = 1: RMM-DIIS algorithm\nIBRION = 2: Congugate-Gradient algorithm\nUsually, it is recommended to use 2.\nFor conjugate-gradient, see: https://qiita.com/Dason08/items/27559e192a6a977dd5e5\n\n\nNSW is the maximum number of optimization step. Usually, set this value to 10-200 steps.\n\nKPOINTS and POTCAR\n\nThese files should be set as usual. Since this this the bulk calculation, it is better to set k-points = 3x3x3 or larger for meaningful calculation.\nPOTCAR for Pt atom should be set.\n\nExecure\n\nExecute VASP calculation as usual.\n\nChecking output\n\nThe simplest method to see the optimization process is to use ASE; ase gui vasprun.xml or ase gui OUTCAR.\nIf the GUI of your remote environment (TSUBAME etc.) is slow, download your vasprun.xml or OUTCAR file to your local computer (via scp or any) then use ase gui vasprun.xml or ase gui OUTCAR.\nBy using above, you can see the atoms are moving. This is what the geometry optimizaitons are doing: the atoms are relaxed, in order to lower the energy.\nAlso check the energy in OUTCAR (the latter value of the following line):\nenergy without entropy = -1070.27460902  energy(sigma->0) = -1070.45373832\ngrep is useful for this purpose: grep \"energy  without entropy\" OUTCAR\n\n\nYou can see the energy is (mostly) decreasing. If it reached the minimum, the optimization is finished.\n\nUnit cell optimization\n\nTo change the unit cell size and shape, insert the following tag in INCAR.\nISIF = 3: changing cell volume, shape, and atomic positions\nISIF = 4: changing cell shape and atomic positions\nDefault ISIF is 2 (changing atomic positions)\nDetails can be seen in https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/ISIF\n\n\n\nExercise\n\nDownload the FCC metals (nickel, platinum, silver) and do the cell optimization. Compare the calculated lattice constants.\n\n\nOptimization of surface\n\nThe geometry optimization of surface is mostly same with the bulk optimization, but several differences existss.\n\nFixing the surface\n\nIn surface optimization, part of the surface (or called slab) is fixed or frozen from its initial position.\nThis is because we often mimic the surface material by fixing (or freezing) the lower part of the system. This is reasonable, because, in reallity, only surface atoms moves significantly and lower part have similar structure with bulk material.\nTo do such calculation, we fix the lower part of the surface model and only relax the upper layers. This can be done with POSCAR setting.\nLet's take the Pt surface as example (file). This is made by just changing the unit cell size by extending the z-direction (check it by ase gui or VESTA).Pt \n1.0000000\n   3.9231600    0.0000000    0.0000000\n   0.0000000    3.9231600    0.0000000\n   0.0000000    0.0000000   20.0000000\nPt \n 4\nCartesian\n0.0000000  0.0000000  0.0000000\n1.9615800  1.9615800  0.0000000\n0.0000000  1.9615800  1.9615800\n1.9615800  0.0000000  1.9615800\n\nThen, let's change it as follows:Pt \n1.0000000\n   3.9231600    0.0000000    0.0000000\n   0.0000000    3.9231600    0.0000000\n   0.0000000    0.0000000   20.0000000\nPt \n 4\nSelective dynamics\nCartesian\n0.0000000  0.0000000  0.0000000   F   F   F\n1.9615800  1.9615800  0.0000000   F   F   F\n0.0000000  1.9615800  1.9615800   T   T   T\n1.9615800  0.0000000  1.9615800   T   T   T\n\nThe Selective dynamics indicates we have both fixed and relax atoms.\nF F F or T T T of each atom is the answer to the question: Do you want this atom to move?. F means False thus does not move, and T means True so it allows to move atom.\nase gui of this POSCAR distinguishes fixed and free atoms (with check mark for atoms) while vesta does not make distinction.\nAfter changing POSCAR, execute VASP and see the relaxed structure.\n\nUsing ASE (Advanced topic)\n\nWith ASE, fixing the surface can be done by setting constraint property of Atoms.\nTo use this function, tag of Atoms should be used; tags are automatically set when surface is made with ASE.\nadsorbate: tag = 0, surface layer: tag = 1, etc.\nLower (i.e. smaller in z-coordinate) surface layers have large tag values.\n\n\nBy using this tag and ase.constraints.FixAtoms, the constraint property can be set.\n```python\nfrom ase.constraints import FixAtoms\nfrom ase.build import fcc111\nfrom ase.io import write\nfrom ase.visualize import view\n\nsurf = fcc111(symbol='Pd', size=[3, 3, 4], a=3.99, vacuum=10.0)\nconstraints = FixAtoms(indices=[atom.index for atom in surf if atom.tag >= 3])\nsurf.constraints = constraints\nwrite(\"POSCAR\", surf)\n```\nExercise\n\nConfirm the optimization process by ase gui.\n\n"},"english/transition_state.html":{"url":"english/transition_state.html","title":"Transition state optimization","keywords":"","body":"Transition state\n\nIn chemical reaction, we can define the reactant state as the starting state of some reaction and the product state as the state that the reaction is completed.\nThe transition state lays in between the reactant state and product state.

The equation of motion is the Newton's F=maF = maF=ma in classical MD simulation.\nIn the classical MD simulation, the nuclei are the only particle move because there is no electron's degree-of-freedom in classical mechanics.\nIn quantum MD simulation, mostly the nuclei are the only particle move because motion of electrons and nuclei are quite different in time scale (Born-Oppenheimer approximation).\nTherefore, in most of the quantum MD calculation, atoms move on the potential energy surface (PES), and PES is calculated by solving the Schrodinger equation at each nuclei geometry.\nThis procedure is very similar to the geometry optimization. In optimization, one is trying to find the minimum on the PES, while in MD one can move on the PES.\n\nEnsembles in MD calculation\n\nIn MD simulation, we need to choose conserved variables. Possible variables are\n\nNNN: number of particles (atoms, molecules)\nVVV: volume of the simulation cell\nTTT: temperature\nPPP: pressure\nHHH: enthalpy\n\n\nThe conserved variables are the variables kept constant during the MD simulation.\n\nUsually, three variables are chosen for the MD calculation, and the MD simulation is labeled by these conserved variables.\nFour types of ensembles are possible in VASP: NVE, NVT, NpT, and NpH. Among them, formar two ensembles are widely used, and also called microcanonical ensemble and canonical ensemble, respectively.\nNVT simulation is more usual so we will cover it here. Keeping NNN means we have no generation or elimination of the atoms or electsons (as usual simulations does). Keeping VVV means cell size is fixed during the simulation. So additional factor is the temperature of the system.\nTo control the temperature, we use thermostat. This is the heat bath connected to the system, and it supplies or extract the temperature to adjust the system's temperature to the target temperature value.\nFor NVTNVTNVT simulation, we have two options in VASP.\nBerendsen thermostat\nAndersen thermostat\nNose-Hoover thermostat\nLangevion thermostat\nMultiple Andersen thermostat\n\n\nAmong them, Berendesen and Nose-Hoover is popular so we will cover them here. How to set these thermostats with INCAR will be introduced later.\nUsually Berendsen thermostat is easier to use but Nose-Hoover is better from theoretical viewpoint. So we learn to use the Berendsen thermostat in this page.\nThe full details of the MD calculation in VASP is shown in https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Molecular_dynamics_calculations\n\nINCAR setting\n\nThe MD-specific keywords are as follows:\nCommon to all MD calculation\nSet IBRION to 0.\nNSW: The number of steps (same with geometry optimization).\nPOTIM: In MD calculation, this means the timestep in femtosecond (fs, 10−1510^{-15}10−15 s). Usually, 0.5-2.0 should be used.\n\n\nCommon to all NVT MD calculation\nTEBEG: Target temperature (in Kelvin) at the beggining of the MD.\nTEEND: Target temperature at the end of the MD. If this value is different from TEBEG, gradual increase/decrease of temperature during MD is taken.\n\n\nWhen using Berendsen thermostat\nSet SMASS to -1.\nNBLOCK: Frequency of the velocity scaling. Setting this value to, for example 10, means temperature is scaled every 10 steps.\n\n\nWhen using Nose-Hoover thermostat\n\nSet SMASS to some positive value (0.5~2.0 is standard).\nMDALGO = 2.\n\n\nSo the INCAR part for the Berendsen NVT MD becomes like\n\n\nIBRION =  0\nPOTIM  =  1.0\nSMASS  = -1\nNSW    =  100\nNBLOCK =  10\nTEBEG  =  300\nTEEND  =  300\n\nIn Nose-Hoover, temperature fluctuates around the target value. Adjusting the SMASS value may resolve this to some extent.\nSMASS in Nose-Hoover controls the frequency of the coupling to the heat bath, so it is a parameter we need to fix. Usually, larger SMASS leads slow increase/decrease of temperature.\n\nPOSCAR\n\nAny POSCAR file is fine. A file with 32 water molecules are prepared; see POSCAR_MD.\nCopy it to POSCAR and do the calculation.\n\nKPOINTS\n\nNothing special with the KPOINTS file. For above water case, 1x1x1 k-point is fine.\n\nPOTCAR\n\nPrepare as usual.\n\nOUTPUT\n\nIn standard output (.out) or OSZICAR, the simulation temperature is written (T=300). See how these temperatures are changing.\nThe trajectory can be seen in vasprun.xml or OUTCAR file. vasurun.xml is lighter in size so analyze it by ase gui vasprun.xml (after getting .xml file to your local PC).\n\nExersice\n\nPerform the MD calculation above.\n\n"}}}
