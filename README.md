# VASP how to
* This repository is for those who want to learn the DFT (density functional theory) calculations using VASP.
* VASP stands for Vienna ab initio simulation package, and it is the software package to do the DFT calculation with plane-wave basis set.
* For beginners in the DFT to do VASP, learn by the following order:
    1. [linux.md (jumps to a file in other repository)](https://github.com/ishikawa-group/gaussian_how_to/blob/main/linux.md)
    2. energy_molecule.md
    3. energy_bulk.md
    4. optimize.md

* Followings should be seen if necessary:
    + [tsubame.md (jumps to a file in other repository)](https://github.com/ishikawa-group/gaussian_how_to/blob/main/tsubame.md)
    + compile.md
