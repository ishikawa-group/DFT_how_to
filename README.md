# VASP how to
* This repository is for those who want to learn the DFT (density functional theory) calculations using VASP.
* VASP stands for Vienna ab initio simulation package, and it is the software package to do the DFT calculation with plane-wave basis set.
* For beginners in the DFT to do VASP, learn by the following order:
    1. [linux.md (jumps to a file in other repository)](https://github.com/ishikawa-group/gaussian_how_to/blob/main/linux.md)
    2. [energy_molecule.md](./english/energy_molecule.md)
    3. [energy_bulk.md](./english/energy_bulk.md)
    4. [optimize.md](./english/optimize.md)
    5. [molecular_dynamics.md](./english/molecular_dynamics.md)

* Followings should be seen if necessary:
    + [tsubame.md (jumps to a file in other repository)](https://github.com/ishikawa-group/gaussian_how_to/blob/main/tsubame.md)
    + [compile.md (Japanese only)](./japanese/compile.md)
    
* The `test` directory contains input files for a simple VASP calculaiton. You can use it to check your VASP compiation is correctly done or not.
  These examples are selected from VASP wiki.
